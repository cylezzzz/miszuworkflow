## 🧠 What is MISZU?

**MISZU Workflow** is a node-based canvas for building, understanding, and executing workflows with the help of AI agents.

Think of it as:

- 🧩 **Visual logic** instead of spaghetti code  
- 🤖 **Agent-assisted creation** via chat, text, and later voice  
- 🌐 **LAN-first** before any cloud nonsense  
- ☁️ **Cloud-ready** once it actually works  
- 🛠️ Inspired by **ComfyUI**, **n8n**, and real-world frustration

No fluff. No magic buttons. You see what happens.
